			<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
			<p>
				Technical Game Designer interested in pursuing all things
				Game Design and Software Development. Energetic,
				Enthusiastic, and Dependable with a passion for all things
				technical and pertaining to game design and implementation.
				Worked on multiple games, side projects, and coursework in
				web/app development, data analysis, statistics, and game
				design. I hope to enjoy a life and career creating video
				games that empower and inspire people the same way that I
				have been to pursue my dreams and passions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time, I spend time working out, making and 
				playing video games (no suprise there) and cooking. I am
				always looking for new recipes to make and how to spice them up.
				Other interests I have in software engineering other then video games
				are web/app development, data science and cyber security.
